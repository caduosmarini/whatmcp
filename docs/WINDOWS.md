# Windows: iPhone history plus WhatsApp Desktop increments

The iPhone backup is the historical base. Windows Desktop contributes later
messages to the **same durable archive**. Neither source is ever overwritten.
The Windows app's local databases are encrypted; pointing WhatMCP at
`genericStorage.db` does not work. WhatMCP invokes the separate
[WAren6 fork](https://github.com/caduosmarini/WAren6) GPL-3.0 tool in offline mode, then
imports its validated `unified_whatsapp.db`. No WAren6 code is bundled here.

## One-time setup

1. Install WhatsApp Desktop and sign in. Install Node 22.6+ and PowerShell.
2. Clone WAren6 separately and review its requirements:

   ```powershell
   git clone https://github.com/caduosmarini/WAren6.git C:\path\to\WAren6
   ```

3. Keep the WhatMCP archive and API key outside the checkout. If using a
   nondefault location, set `WHATMCP_HOME` in the shell **and** in the MCP
   configuration. Then configure the Windows source:

   ```powershell
   npm run wa -- windows-source C:\path\to\WAren6
   ```

   This writes `source_type=windows-waren6` and `windows_waren6_path` to
   `config.json`; it does not run extraction. Optional config field
   `windows_output_dir` changes the private case directory (default:
   `WHATMCP_HOME\windows-cases`).

4. An already completed WAren6 case can be imported without running WAren6
   again:

   ```powershell
   npm run wa -- import-windows C:\path\to\unified_whatsapp.db
   npm run wa -- embed
   ```

   `import-windows` checks the SQLite schema and `quick_check`. The first pass
   imports records newer than the newest message already in the archive. Later
   passes revisit the last seven days; stable `chat_jid:msg_id` keys prevent
   duplicates. Rows without a stable message ID are counted and skipped.
   `--full` intentionally scans all available Windows records, without deleting
   the iPhone history. Embedding sends new text windows to OpenAI, as in macOS.

## Acquisition without closing WhatsApp

`npm run sync` uses `scripts/sync-hotcopy-windows.ps1` to copy LocalState,
WebView2 IndexedDB and Local Storage while WhatsApp remains open. It then runs
WAren6 offline against that copy with `-f -n -m -NoArchive -PreservedCopy`, validates
the new case and imports its `unified_whatsapp.db`. Manual sync also embeds new
windows. There is no close/reopen step or confirmation dialog.

Use the WAren6 fork's preserved-copy implementation, starting at commit
`e53aa64`. Use `3fd7f19` or newer for the quoted-reply index that avoids
repeated full-chat scans during unification. The audio acquisition described here
also requires the hash-based media linking and in-memory acquisition callback
from `865b9e8` on the fork's `windows-audio-media-linking` branch, or a later
revision containing those changes. Until merged, check out that branch explicitly.
It refuses an incomplete preserved source instead of falling back to
live acquisition. Upstream WAren6 remains available at
https://github.com/MayukXT/WAren6. WhatMCP invokes this GPL-3.0 dependency as a
separate process; its implementation is not bundled in this MIT repository.

A live file copy is not an atomic snapshot. Files can change during copying;
copy diagnostics, WAren6 validation and SQLite integrity checks gate import.
Failed validation rejects the run and preserves the existing archive. Successful
checks establish that the captured case is usable, not that every live message
was captured at one exact instant. A later sync revisits recent messages.

Cases contain decrypted personal data and key material. Keep cases, logs,
configuration, certificates and the archive outside Git and cloud-sync folders.
The hot-copy pipeline keeps its latest two owned runs and its last successful
run if older. The same policy covers the external `windows_output_dir` cases.
Only directories with a matching WhatMCP ownership marker are pruned; existing
unmarked cases and user backups are preserved. Imported audio lives outside
these ephemeral cases, under `WHATMCP_HOME/media/windows`, so pruning a case
cannot remove linked voice messages.

## Audio and setup

`npm run setup` lets Windows users choose native WAren6 acquisition or a
compatible ChatStorage import. `doctor` validates the selected source. Native
acquisition preserves known audio formats from transfer folders, in addition to
the WebView database evidence. Images and documents are not imported into the
media/transcription archive. The media index links voice messages without filenames
by their SHA-256. The acquisition helper recovers exact matching ciphertext from
the Windows HTTP cache and can fetch missing audio from verified WhatsApp HTTPS
endpoints. It authenticates and checks the plaintext hash and size before import;
unavailable or mismatched audio leaves the original message intact. Private media
keys remain in memory and are passed only to the fixed local helper.

The audio importer verifies bytes against the case hash and size, preserves
stable message IDs, and discovers late media even below the message watermark.
It retains existing transcripts and searchable text while replacement audio is
pending. See [Audio transcription](AUDIO.md) for local `faster-whisper` or opt-in `gpt-transcribe`, one
default language (`pt-BR`), decoder paths, costs and manual processing.

For local transcription, install the pinned dependencies from
`src/transcription/local-whisper-requirements.txt` in a Python environment and
set `transcription_local_python_path` and `transcription_local_model_path` to
existing paths. `npm run wa -- transcribe-models` checks the runtime and cached
model without downloading model files. The account running the scheduled task
or service needs read and execute access to Python and read access to every
model file, including the targets of any cache symlinks.

## Scheduled collection

For the sibling `whatmcp`, `WAren6` and private `data` directory layout, run:

```powershell
powershell.exe -NoProfile -ExecutionPolicy Bypass -File scripts/register-hotcopy-task.ps1 -IntervalHours 2
```

The `WhatMCP Hot Copy` task uses an invisible launcher under the interactive
user's profile. The user must be signed in. Configure `data/runtime-windows.json`
with `python_path` when Python is unavailable on that user's PATH. The task
collects, validates and imports, then generates all pending embeddings.
If `transcription_auto_after_import` is `true`, it first transcribes all pending
accessible audio with the configured model. The same option applies to manual
sync, index, media import and WAren6 case imports; it defaults to `false`.

Alternatively, `npm run wa -- sync-every <hours>` creates the per-user
`WhatMCP Sync` task, which also embeds missing windows. `sync-every 0` removes
that task. Choose one schedule to avoid redundant acquisitions. Both use the
supervised sync worker, and neither closes WhatsApp or places credentials on
the command line.

## Upstream v0.2.0 integration

Windows sync uses the upstream supervised worker and SQLite process lock, with a
30-minute timeout (ChatStorage defaults to 10 minutes). The watchdog
uses the configurable `sync_timeout_minutes` base and adds 45 minutes when automatic audio transcription is enabled (75 minutes total
on Windows, 55 for ChatStorage). A timeout
pauses scheduled attempts until a successful manual retry. On Windows the worker
and its helper processes are terminated together; WhatsApp remains open.

The hidden scheduled launcher runs `sync --scheduled`: collection, validation,
import and pending embeddings run on every synchronization. Manual CLI, MCP and
dashboard sync also generate pending embeddings. Existing vectors are reused;
only missing vectors require embedding API calls. Configure `windows_source_path` when
a service account must refer to another user's live WhatsApp package directory.
The account must have access to the source and any required user credentials.

## MCP client timeout

Windows collection can take several minutes. Configure the MCP client's tool
call timeout above the server's 30-minute watchdog, rather than abandoning the
request while extraction is still running. In an existing Codex
`[mcp_servers.whatmcp]` entry, set `tool_timeout_sec = 1900` and reload the MCP
connection to apply it. Remote clients need their own timeout configuration.
With automatic audio enabled, use `tool_timeout_sec = 4600` to exceed the
75-minute Windows watchdog. Reload the client connection after changing it.
The source service and scheduled task are independent of that client setting.
Read tools query the existing archive without triggering collection; request
`sync_archive` only for an explicit refresh or when newer data is necessary.

## Validation

Run `npm test` on each platform. The synthetic/offline suite includes
PowerShell syntax and the subprocess protocol when running on Windows;
platform-specific checks are skipped on macOS. The native Apple speech smoke check
is separate and opt-in. These checks do not exercise a live encrypted WhatsApp
package, a real WAren6 acquisition, Windows account credentials, or a paid audio
API request. Validate one real collection under the intended Windows service or
interactive account before relying on that environment.

Run the cache and local Whisper protocol tests separately; they use synthetic
data and do not require the Whisper model or upload audio:

```powershell
python test/windows-cache-audio.test.py
python test/local-whisper.test.py
```
